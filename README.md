# WinDbgX

Latest build: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ymm266opxtsrgnht?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShMask/windbgx)

WinDbg is scary to newcomers, and even for veterans it leaves much to be desired. Its UI is basic, and provides very little for most scenarios.
WinDbgX attempts to create a WinDbg alternative based on the same DbgEng.Dll debugger engine, but use WPF to create better UI,
with support for extension commands as well as built-in commands.
